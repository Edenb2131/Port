Hello,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your Okta SSO integration. We're glad to assist you in configuring it with our platform.
We offer integrations with several Single Sign-On (SSO) providers to facilitate seamless authentication processes for our users.
Among these, Okta stands as one of our supported SSO providers.
In order to proceed with the configuration on our end, we kindly ask you to provide us with Okta Domain and Client ID.

Firstly, please make sure you have created an Okta integrations. If not, go to Applications -> Applications and then click on "Create App Integration".
Choose the "OIDC - OpenID Connect" option and "Single-Page application".
After that, you will need to configure the integrations. So choose an app integration name and an application logo you desire.
Under Grant type mark all options and under Sign-in redirect URIs set: https://auth.getport.io/login/callback.
Remove the sign-out redirect URIs and under Assignments -> controlled access: Set Allow everyone in your organization to access.

After that, you'll need to configure OIDC settings. 
Get your Okta Domain by clicking on your user mail at the top-right corner of the Okta management interface,
hovering on the okta domain (will be in the format {YOUR_COMPANY_NAME}.okta.com) and clicking on Copy to clipboard.
Then, Under General tab, Copy the Client ID and send it to Port along with the Okta Domain from the previous step (on the slack channel/Intercom).
After that, click on edit and set the Login initiated by option to either Okta or App and mark all under Application visibility.
Check Login flow to be Redirect to app to initiate login (OIDC Compliant) and under initiate login URI paste:
"https://auth.getport.io/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=96IeqL36Q0UIBxIfV1oqOkDWU6UslfDj&connection={CONNECTION_NAME}&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.getport.io".
After that, don't forget to click save.
Lastly, we'll need to allow pulling Okta groups to Port. 
Under OpenID Connect Token click Edit, then add a Groups claim type and choose the option filter and select Matches regex.* in Groups claim filter.

Once we receive the requierd information, we'll be able to assist you further in configuring the integration.
