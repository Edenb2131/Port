Hello,

Let me offer a solution to “IN PROGRESS” status indefinitely showing on the self-service on Port.

First, check GitHub Workflow Configuration. Please make sure you configured the .yml correctly and with the right triggers and conditions.
Are there any specific events or conditions that need to be met for the workflow to run?

Secondly, please verify Port integration settings to GitHub is correctly configured. Did you allow the appropriate permissions and scopes to trigger workflows?

Lastly, in the self-service action, Are all the required fields filled out correctly, such as the repository name, workflow file path, and trigger conditions?
it might be a good idea to check again.

After all of it, if you still strugling with that, you can check our doucumntaion here: "https://docs.getport.io/create-self-service-experiences/"
And also, send us a Slack message.


Best,
Support team.
